        highlights:
          - Developed an automated trace-based analyzer, Bugfox, to identify the root cause of software regressions in JavaScript applications. The tool uses heuristic strategies based on invocation order and frequency, achieving 83% accuracy on 12 real-world regressions from the BugsJS benchmark. Bugfox effectively diagnoses those regressions with minimal memory overhead and fast performance, solving each regression in under 1 minute.
